		  README FOR GENERATED DOCUMENTATION

The documentation in this directory is generated using PhpDocumentor,
a standard PEAR package.  You may already have  PhpDocumentor
installed on your system.  To check, give the console command

  pear list

and examine the output for PhpDocumentor.  The version should be at
least 1.3.0RC3 beta.  If you do not have PhpDocumentor, you can
install it with the command

  pear install PhpDocumentor

With PhpDocumentor installed, you can generate current documentation
by giving the console command

  phpdoc -c phpdoc.ini

in this directory.
